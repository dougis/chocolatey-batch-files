These scripts should make installing and using Chocolatey simpler
They both need to be run as admin (right click, run as Administrator)

In ChocoInstallUpdatePackages.bat there are a set of arrays which are then used to build a final array
This allows for example leaving the Games array filled with the items you would use on your home machine but not adding it to the final items array when installing on a work machine

Additions/other arrays are welcome

Hope they help and enjoy
